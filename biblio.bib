               monitored) in another. Special hooks are put in place to
               allow the IDS to access some state from the VMM and the
               guest OS. And then an architecture is built to allow for
               the IDS to make queries about the guest OS using
               system-level calls and react on the results of those calls
               via a policy engine.},

The main idea was to create a predicate for an attack (or a vulnerability) and then use that predicate to search the history of a computer and see if the vulnerability had ever been triggered. The idea here is to allow administrators to have some level of confidence that their machines were not exploited with a vulnerability at some time in the past.},

We will not try to determine whether the backdoor threat is realistic or not, but we will assume that a bug or a backdoor exists and analyse the consequences on systems. We will show how it is possible for an attacker to implement a simple and generic CPU backdoor to be later able to bypass mandatory security mechanisms with very limited initial privileges. We will explain practical difficulties and show proof of concept schemes using a modified Qemu CPU emulator. Backdoors studied in this paper are all usable from the software level without any physical access to the hardware.},

	Abstract = {Application-level firewalls block traffic based on the process that is sending or receiving the network flow. They help detect bots, worms, and backdoors that send or receive malicious packets without the knowledge of users. Recent attacks show that these firewalls can be disabled by knowledgeable attackers. To counter this threat, we develop VMwall, a fine-grained tamper-resistant process-oriented firewall. VMwall's design blends the process knowledge of application-level firewalls with the isolation of traditional stand-alone firewalls. VMwall uses the Xen hypervisor to provide protection from malware, and it correlates TCP or UDP traffic with process information using virtual machine introspection. Experiments show that VMwall successfully blocks numerous real attacks---bots, worms, and backdoors---against a Linux system while allowing all legitimate network flows. VMwall is performant, imposing only a 0--1 millisecond delay on TCP connection establishment, less than a millisecond delay on UDP connections, and a 1--7% slowdown on network-bound applications. Our attack analysis argues that with the use of appropriate external protection of guest kernels, VMwall's introspection remains robust and helps identify malicious traffic. },
