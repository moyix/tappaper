\begin{abstract}

The ability to introspect into the behavior of software at runtime is
crucial for many security-related tasks, such as virtual machine-based
intrusion detection and low-artifact malware analysis. Although some
progress has been made in this task by automatically creating programs
that can passively retrieve kernel-level information, two key challenges
remain. First, it is currently difficult to extract useful information
from user-level applications, such as web browsers. Second, discovering
points within the OS and applications to hook for \emph{active
monitoring} is still an entirely manual process. In this paper we
propose a set of techniques to mine the memory accesses made by an
operating system and its applications to locate useful places to deploy
active monitoring, which we call \emph{tap points}. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our techniques by finding tap points for four useful
introspection tasks such as finding SSL keys and monitoring web browser
activity on five different operating systems (Windows 7, Linux, FreeBSD,
Minix and Haiku) and two processor architectures (ARM and x86).
