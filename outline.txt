Introduction
    Gaps in VMI:
        No app-level introspection
        Hard to find data that is not exposed via APIs
    Tap points as semantically meaningful units
    This paper: techniques for finding useful tap points
Fully Supervised
    URLs
    SSL keys
Semi-Supervised
    Give examples and use supervised ML techniques
Unsupervised
    Text-finding
    Clustering tap points by memory access
Experiments
    For all experiments, try with: Haiku, Windows (8?) and Linux
    Fully Supervised
        URLs in IE9/10, Chrome
        SSL keys in IE, malware (synthetic if necessary)
    Semi-Supervised
        Train on disk-based registry, find reg op tap points
        Train on one version of dmesg (debian-amd64), find in arm or mips
    Unsupervised
Limitations
    Not applicable to memory analysis
    Attacks
        Could something work with just encoded data?
        Randomize tap locations using something like JIT
