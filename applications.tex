\section{Applications}

\subsection{Malware Analysis}

As we will show in Section \ref{sec:eval:subsec:supervised}, TZB can be used for malware analysis in some cases.

\subsection{VM-Based Security and Intrusion Detection}

Little bit about comparing network traffic to VM data?

Tap points for SSL interception without man in the middle (more in evaluation section).

\subsection{Debugging}

Maybe mention booting embedded systems here? Find internal log buffers, etc.
