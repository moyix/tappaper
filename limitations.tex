\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:limitations}

Not applicable to memory analysis \\

\noindent Call stack information may be unavailable / costly \\

Remember to cite the notion of a shadow stack, and see if we can find
something about the security of stack-walking.

\noindent
Attacks

\begin{itemize}
\item Split up data reads/writes into noncontiguous chunks and process separately -- obscure semantics
\item Randomize tap locations using something like JIT
\end{itemize}
