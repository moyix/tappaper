Goal:
Quickly find points at which to interpose (tap points) for
introspection.

Technique:
Watch data as it moves between CPU and memory (i.e. as it is read and
written) and separate out the contents based on program point. Analyze
the content produced at each tap point and find ones that write data of
interest to introspection.

Prerequisites:
1. The desired data is written to or read from memory at some point.
2. The behavior which causes the data to be read or written can be
   induced.
3. The format of the data can be guessed.
